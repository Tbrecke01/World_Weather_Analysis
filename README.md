# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Utilizing the OpenWeather and Google Maps API to pull information about 2000 cities across the world. This information is used to help an individual choose their ideal travel location and from there construct a travel itenerary.

## Tools
Python, citipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Google Maps API, OpenWeatherMap API, Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
- The app allows an individual to specify their ideal temperatures for a vacation. From there, a ticker map is generated with a ticker for each city that meets the individuals preferences. The tickers also includes details about the current weather in the area, local hotels, and what country the city is in.
- From there, an individual can use the 'itinerary' code to select up to 4 cities that they wish to visit, and a map with directions between the cities will be created. This map also includes tickers with the same information as above for the 4 cities.
